# Senior-Project
This is my senior project for my senior year at Oregon Institute of Technology.

This is a C# WinForms class library that creates a taskbar toolbar for monitoring system resource usage.

Resources include:
* CPU Usage/Temperature
* GPU Usage/Temperature
* RAM Usage
* Disk Read/Write Rate
* Network Upload/Download Rate

This project has been replaced with the Monitor project.
