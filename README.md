# Senior-Project
## Overview
This is my senior project for my senior year at Oregon Institute of Technology.

This is a C# WinForms class library that creates a taskbar toolbar for monitoring system resource usage.

Resources include:
* CPU Usage/Temperature
* GPU Usage/Temperature
* RAM Usage
* Disk Read/Write Rate
* Network Upload/Download Rate

## External Libraries
This project uses CSDeskBand for easier interfacing with the Windows Taskbar.

See: https://github.com/dsafa/CSDeskBand

## Notes
Due to technical difficulties with Windows Taskbar Applications, this project has been abandoned in favor of the monitor project.
